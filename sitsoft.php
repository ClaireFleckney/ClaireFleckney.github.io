            <p>SIT SOFTware (Students In Technology) is a team formed to complete the capstone project "Open Road" during the Systems Analysis and Design course. Open Road is an Information System created for the Precision Riding Academy in Lethbridge, Alberta. It is designed to allow Students to self-register for classes, and for Instructors and Administrators to manage all aspects of the Riding Academy.</p>
            <p>Working as the Lead Front-End Developer on the project, I am responsible for implementing all features necessary for the web portal to interact with the rest of the system, while ensuring good UI/UX Design, while still being involved in all other aspects of the system.</p>
